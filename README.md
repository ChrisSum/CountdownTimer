1) Approximately 50 minutes were spent on this assignment.

2) I decided to use JavaScript for its ease of use when dealing with HTML elements. Also the easy to use alert method for the user message played a part in my decision. This assignment was written in Sublime Text Editor and Google Chrome developer inspection tools were used to test and debug.

3) I would like to add a column for days on the countdown so the user can get a clearer picture of exactly how much time is left. I am also aware using jQuery may have shortened the script but I wanted to be sure I could single out any element for stylistic purposes.
